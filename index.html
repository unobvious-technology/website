    <h2>We research & build software to improve the safety, security and profitability of Sex Workers</h2>

    <p>Today we live in a world where sex workers, and the adult industry they
      make possible, are a segregated part of society and the Internet.</p>
    <p>Sex Workers are often refused services or prohibited from using the same
      platforms as everyone else. This leads to a multi-billion dollar industry
      being driven underground.</p>
    <p>Many companies in the industry have become incumbents with little
      interest in innovating, instead just profiteering off the backs of sex
      workers. A large percentage of companies also operate in the shadows with
      little transparency, no public representatives, or openness due to fears of
      being refused services.</p>
    <p>At <strong class="logotype">Unobvious Technology</strong>, we're
      developing new products and services to improve the safety, security and
      profitability of sex-workers, and drive the adult industry forwards. Instead
      of hiding in the shadows, we're dedicated to doing business in an open and
      transparent manner.</p>
    <p>Founded by <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/thisismissem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emelia
        Smith</a> in 2017, with incorporation in 2020, we are 100% bootstrapped,
      without external venture capital or investment, so you don't have to worry
      about us being sellouts and screwing over those who depend on us in the
      future, but that does mean we move a little slower.</p>
